## How to execute the project

To run the quad art generation file use the following command \
`python quad_art_generate.py file_name.jpg`

Here file_name should be replaced the file you have

To create the OpenGL window, run the following for compiling \
`gcc -o main animation_window.c tinyfiledialogs/tinyfiledialogs.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut`

And then run the output file

### Points to note

Don't change the size of the window, unexpected behaviour will arise for now
