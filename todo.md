Fix the gif creation issue

## Create another file that does the following

create an animation viewing window with playback controls

1. create a blank window using opengl
2. display project title below which team members will be displayed.
3. And then in the center we can have image upload button
4. Call the first program to generate the output file
5. have a box inside the window which will display the gif
6. add buttons at the bottom of the box to control the playback of the gif
